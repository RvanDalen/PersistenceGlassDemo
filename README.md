# PersistenceGlassDemo

I developed this using Sc 8.1.151207. Though it should work on other versions too as long as you reinstall the Glass.Mapper libraries to get the right dlls and configuration.

## To install:

1. Add Sitecore dlls to /Depends/Sitecore/ (Sitecore.ContentSearch, Sitecore.ContentSearch.Linq, Sitecore.Kernel, Sitecore.Mvc)
2. Create a clean Sitecore site (ie using SIM)
3. Modify publishing target to match the Website folder of the clean Sitecore site
4. Install package
5. Publish
6. Enjoy

Blog about this post coming soon.
